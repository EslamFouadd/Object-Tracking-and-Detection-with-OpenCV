# Object-Tracking-and-Detection-with-OpenCV
This object tracking algorithm is called centroid tracking as it relies on the Euclidean distance between (1) existing object centroids (i.e., objects the centroid tracker has already seen before) and (2) new object centroids between subsequent frames in a video.
